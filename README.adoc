# Salary Reporting Tool



## user Story
Our company wants to report on employee salaries using multithreading. Given a REST-API (https://dummy.restapiexample.com/public/api/v1/employees) that returns a list of employees with their salaries, we want to report the following:

1. Total SUM of salaries

2. Average salary

3. Minimum salary

4. Maximum salary

5. Percentage deviation of each employee's salary from the average salary

## Development Notes
1. This tool is developed using JAVA (spring boot) [boiler plate is used to geenrate basic structure]
2. The API is called once to retrieve all the data
3. Each aggregation method (SUM, average, min, max) is calculated in parallel using concurrent & multi-threading concepts
4. Each employee's deviation is also calculated in parallel and the results are collected in a map (name, deviation)
5. The process/calculation flow is logged in the console in an asynchronous manner
6. The final result is stored in a JSON format in the file system in the following format:


```bash
  {
    sum: X,
    avg: X,
    min: X,
    max: X,
    deviations: [
        { name: "Joe Doe", deviation: 5%),
        {...}
    ]
}

```


## How to use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Run the application by running  ``` ./gradlew bootRun    ```
4. The final result will be stored in a file named "result.json" in the root directory of the project
